# rxjs-operators

This library contains additional operators for [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/)
that we at [co-IT](https://co-IT.eu) believe help in certain use cases.

## Setup

```bash
npm install @co-IT/rxjs-operators
```

## Customized buffer behavior

You will find `bufferMatch` & `bufferObserve` allowing you to filter values
of the buffer.
This gives you more control when a buffer should be emitted.

- üìñ Check out our blog post [Filterable Buffer](https://medium.com/@gregor.woiwode/rxjs-filterable-buffer-dd1d739f60ec) to learn more.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è You can see those operators in action at [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-hotkey-co-it)
