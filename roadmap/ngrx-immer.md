# NgRx-Immer

The bad news is `ngrx-immer` is not ready yet.
It is planned that this package provides the same feature set as `ngrx-entity`
but using `immer` under the hood.

For now it is not clear if this package will be implemented because we need to
run some performance tests first to check if `immer` better performs than
`ngrx-entity`.

Stay tuned.
